# E-commerce Platform Using Redux Implementation

## Overview

Transitioning from Context API to Redux for improved state management.

## User Story

**As** a senior engineer,  
**I want** to use Redux for global state management,  
**so that** it is decoupled from React.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **Redux Store**: Confirm use over Context API.
- **Provider**: App wraps with `<Provider store={store}>`.
- **Reducers**: State managed through reducers.
- **State Access**: Use `useSelector` for data extraction.
- **Action Dispatch**: Use `useDispatch` for actions.

## Benefits

- Scalability
- Separation of concerns
- Enhanced debugging

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Start with `npm start`.
